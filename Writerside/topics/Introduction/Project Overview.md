# Project Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the ResuMate project, including its vision, goals, and scope.

## Vision

ResuMate aims to revolutionize the job application process by leveraging AI and ML technologies to help users create, 
analyze, and optimize their Résumés and CVs. The platform focuses on enhancing the quality of Résumés, 
making them more appealing to both Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human recruiters.

## Goals

The primary goals of the ResuMate project are to:

- Develop a user-friendly interface for easy  Résumé and CV management.
- Implement advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques for accurate content analysis.
- Provide constructive feedback to help users improve their documents.
- Offer customizable templates to enhance the visual appeal of Résumés and CVs.
- Ensure data privacy and security in compliance with relevant regulations.
- Facilitate continuous learning to improve the platform's feedback mechanisms.
- Deliver a scalable solution capable of handling a growing user base and feature set.

## Scope

### Core Functionalities for MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will include the following core functionalities:

- **Document Upload**: Enable users to upload their Résumés or CVs in various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
- **Content Analysis**: Utilize AI to analyze the document’s content for clarity, relevance, and impact.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Provide AI-generated feedback on how to improve the document.
- **Template Selection**: Allow users to choose from three distinct templates for Résumé or CV creation.
- **Sample Generation**: Offer the ability to auto-generate a sample  Résumé or CV based on user-provided information.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize sections such as work experience, education, and skills.
- **Download**: Enable users to download the updated Résumé or CV in their chosen format.

### Technologies and Frameworks

ResuMate uses a robust stack of technologies and frameworks to deliver its functionalities seamlessly:

- **Backend**: Python with Flask or Django for server-side logic.
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for ML models, spaCy for NLP tasks.
- **Frontend**: Vue.js for an interactive UI, HTML/CSS for structure and style.
- **Database**: SQL database to store user data and document information.
- **Cloud Hosting**: AWS or Azure for hosting the application and database.
- **Version Control**: Git for source code management, hosted on GitHub or GitLab.

### Project Timeline

The project is divided into several key phases, each with specific tasks and milestones:

1. **Project Planning**: Define project scope and MVP, create user stories and epics, develop project timeline and sprints.
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up development and testing environments, configure version control and project management tools.
3. **Data Collection**: Gather  Résumé datasets, define data storage and retrieval mechanisms.
4. **Backend Development**: Implement Résumé parsing, develop content analysis algorithms, create feedback generation logic.
5. **Frontend Development**: Design user interface, develop interactive components, integrate with backend services.
6. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train NLP models, integrate ML models with backend, validate model performance.
7. **Testing**: Write unit tests for individual components, conduct integration testing, perform user acceptance testing.
8. **Documentation**: Document code and system architecture, create developer and user manuals.
9. **Deployment**: Prepare deployment strategy, deploy application to production, monitor application performance.
10. **Project Review and Retrospective**: Review project deliverables, conduct sprint retrospectives, plan for future iterations.

### Future Expansion
