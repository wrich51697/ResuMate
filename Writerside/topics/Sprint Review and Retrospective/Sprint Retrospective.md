# Sprint Retrospective

This document provides a reflection on the progress made during the current sprint, including successes, challenges,
and areas for improvement.

## What Went Well

- **Environment Setup**: Successfully set up the development environment and resolved initial issues with virtual
environment activation.
- **Project Structure**: Established a clear and organized project structure, making it easy to navigate and manage.
- **Implementation**: Implemented key components such as SQLAlchemy for database management, SpaCy for resume parsing, 
and Flask for the web application framework.
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for each phase of the project, ensuring that all steps are 
well-documented and easy to follow.
- **Testing**: Set up the testing environment and created initial test cases, ensuring that the codebase is robust
and reliable.

## What Didn't Go Well

- **Time Management**: Encountered delays due to initial setup issues and miscommunication about the documentation format.
- **Tool Familiarity**: Faced challenges with using Writerside for documentation, resulting in some inefficiencies and confusion.
- **Dependency Issues**: Experienced difficulties with dependency installation and management, particularly with
ensuring all team members had the same environment setup.

## What We Can Improve

- **Clear Communication**: Improve communication about tool usage and documentation standards to avoid misunderstandings
and ensure consistency.
- **Time Estimation**: Better estimate time required for tasks to avoid delays and ensure timely completion of sprint goals.
- **Tool Training**: Provide training sessions or resources on using Writerside and other tools to improve efficiency
and reduce setup time.

## Action Items for Next Sprint

- **Enhanced Documentation**: Continue improving the documentation process, ensuring all steps are clearly outlined 
and easy to follow.
- **Environment Standardization**: Create a standardized setup script or guide to ensure all team members have the 
same development environment.
- **Regular Check-ins**: Implement regular check-ins to monitor progress, address issues promptly, and ensure 
alignment on sprint goals.

## Conclusion

The sprint was productive and resulted in significant progress, despite some challenges. By addressing the identified 
areas for improvement and implementing the action items, we can ensure a smoother and more efficient workflow in
the next sprint.
