# Running Tests

This document provides instructions on how to run tests for the ResuMate project to ensure that all components are functioning correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before running tests, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

- Python is installed and the virtual environment is activated.
- All project dependencies are installed as outlined in the [Dependencies Installation](Dependencies Installation.md) document.
- The testing framework (unittest) is installed.

## Running Tests

<procedure title="Run Tests" id="run-tests">
    <step>
        <p>Activate the virtual environment if it is not already activated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>macOS/Linux:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>source .venv/bin/activate</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Navigate to the root directory of your project:</p>
        <code>
            cd path/to/ResuMate
        </code>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Run the tests using the unittest framework with the following command:</p>
        <code>
            python -m unittest discover -s test -p "*.py"
        </code>
    </step>
</procedure>

## Viewing Test Results

After running the tests, you will see the results displayed in the terminal or command prompt. The results will indicate the number of tests that passed, failed, or were skipped.

## Debugging Test Failures

If any tests fail, follow these steps to debug and resolve the issues:

<procedure title="Debug Test Failures" id="debug-test-failures">
    <step>
        <p>Identify the test that failed and read the error message provided in the test output.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Open the corresponding test file in your code editor and review the test case.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Check the code being tested for potential issues. Ensure that all dependencies and configurations are correctly set up.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <p>Fix any identified issues in the code or test case.</p>
    </step>
    <step>
        <
        <p>Re-run the tests to ensure the issue is resolved:</p>
        <code>
            python -m unittest discover -s test -p "*.py"
        </code>
    </step>
</procedure>

## Best Practices for Writing Tests

To ensure comprehensive and maintainable tests, follow these best practices:

- **Isolate Tests**: Ensure each test is independent and does not rely on the state or results of other tests.
- **Use Meaningful Test Names**: Name your tests descriptively to indicate what functionality they are verifying.
- **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for edge cases and potential failure scenarios to ensure robustness.
- **Keep Tests Simple**: Write clear and concise tests to make them easy to understand and maintain.
- **Automate Testing**: Integrate tests into your continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automate test execution on each code commit.

## Conclusion

Running tests is essential for maintaining the stability and reliability of the ResuMate project. By following these instructions and best practices, you can ensure that all components are thoroughly tested and any issues are promptly identified and resolved.
