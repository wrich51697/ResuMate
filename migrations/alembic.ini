# Author: William Richmond
# Created on: 30 June 2024
# File name: alembic.ini
# Revised: [Add revised date]
#
# Description:
# This configuration file is used by Alembic for database migrations in the ResuMate application.
# It includes settings for migration scripts, logging, and SQLAlchemy connection.
#
# Usage:
#     Place this file in the root directory of your Flask application.
#     Configure the necessary settings for your database connection and migration preferences.
#
# Example:
#     Run the Alembic migration commands:
#     $ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"
#     $ alembic upgrade head

# A generic, single database configuration.

# Use forward slashes (/) also on Windows to provide an OS agnostic path

# Template used to generate migration file names; The default value is %%(rev)s_%%(slug)s
# Uncomment the line below if you want the files to be prepended with date and time
# see https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html#editing-the-ini-file
# for all available tokens
# file_template = %%(year)d_%%(month).2d_%%(day).2d_%%(hour).2d%%(minute).2d-%%(rev)s_%%(slug)s

# Defaults to the current working directory.

# Timezone to use when rendering the date within the migration file
# as well as the filename.
# If specified, requires the python>=3.9 or backports.zoneinfo library.
# Any required deps can installed by adding `alembic[tz]` to the pip requirements
# string value is passed to ZoneInfo()

# Set to 'true' to run the environment during
# the 'revision' command, regardless of autogenerate

# a source .py file to be detected as revisions in the
# versions/ directory

# Version location specification; This defaults
# to migrations/versions. When using multiple version
# directories, initial revisions must be specified with --version-path.
# The path separator used here should be the separator specified by "version_path_separator" below.
# version_locations = %(here)s/bar:%(here)s/bat:migrations/versions

# Version path separator; As mentioned above, this is the character used to split
# version_locations. The default within new alembic.ini files is "os", which uses os.pathsep.
# If this key is omitted entirely, it falls back to the legacy behavior of splitting on spaces and/or commas.
# Valid values for version_path_separator are:
# version_path_separator = :
# version_path_separator = ;
# version_path_separator = space
version_path_separator = os  # Use os.pathsep. Default configuration used for new projects.

# Set to 'true' to search source files recursively
# in each "version_locations" directory
# new in Alembic version 1.10
# recursive_version_locations = false

# are written from script.py.mako
# output_encoding = utf-8

[post_write_hooks]

# Lint with attempts to fix using "ruff" - use the exec runner, execute a binary

# ruff.executable = %(here)s/.venv/bin/ruff
# ruff.options = --fix REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
